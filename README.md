<h2>Description:</h2>
<b>The Smart Security System is design to Assist in Helping Security Profession in protecting builings or apertments.
<h2>HARDWARE:</h2> An LDR sensor, or Light Dependent Resistor, is a passive electronic component whose resistance changes with light intensity, decreasing in bright light and increasing in darkness,
  a phenomenon known as photoconductivity. Made from a high-resistance semiconductor material, 
  its resistance can vary dramatically from megaohms in the dark to just a few hundred ohms in bright light, 
  making it useful for detecting light levels in applications like automatic streetlights, night lamps, and light meters. 
  Ultrasonic sensors detect a multitude of objects contactless and wear-free with ultrasonic waves. It does not matter whether 
  the object is transparent or opaque, metallic or non-metallic, firm, liquid or powdery. Our ultrasonic sensors are available in many different designs, ranges, cone angles and output types.
  BUZZER used as arlam sound emmiter is Arlam system is triggered when both sensors detect an intruder, LCD is included for dispaly, Sevor Moter is used to create rotation of the Front sensor.
  LEDs are included as Lights and Buttons to manually control lights and arlam triggered.

The script is used in this demo where I setup Azure Sentinel (SIEM) and connect it to a live virtual machine acting as a honey pot.
We will observe live attacks (RDP Brute Force) from all around the world. I will use a custom PowerShell script to
look up the attackers Geolocation information and plot it on an Azure Sentinel Map!
